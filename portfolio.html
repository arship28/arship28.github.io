      <p >
         When my parents allowed me the freedom to choose whichever specialty I want to pursue in my undergrad, I walked over to computer science and engineering, and as it was my own choice, I happily faced all the obstacles I encountered while pursuing it. I put hours into learning, understanding the intricate details that come along, while having my own share of struggles as the field appeared as fairly new to me. I find web development to be fascinating, and am currently meddling with front end development, and have also tried exploring my interest in the field of AI, with courses like data mining and neural network. <br>
Till now, I have two publications under my belt, one in IEEE while another in Springer. In addition, I have had my fair share of indulgence in extra-curriculars. I have been a freelance emcee, hosted multiple events, and bagged awards from model UN conferences. I also worked in a national radio station as a radio jockey, where I met and interviewed many artists, professionals, and notable people skilled in diverse areas and provided numerous voice overs. <br>
In the meantime, I was also engaged in academia, and joined as an undergraduate teaching assistant in the department of English and modern languages, due to my earnest interest in reading and literature. In my final year, I joined as a teaching assistant in the trail of my very own major, the department of electrical and computer engineering. <br>
When I am not being my “work and learn” self, I am usually reading a book, browsing through articles, revisiting my harmonium to sing Rabindra Sangeet, trying out a new recipe or chatting with my dad. While there is no end to learning and self-development, currently, I am trying to polish my skills in several areas of my field through courses online.
